# Valcon Landing Page — Pixel Clone

Pixel-accurate static clone of `https://www.hatamex.agency/en` (English home) built from live DOM/CSS forensics.

## Tech

- `index.html` + `assets/css/hatamex.css` (copied from live site) + vanilla `script.js`
- Local font files in `assets/media/` (copied from live site)
- Playwright (`playwright-core`) for screenshot validation

## Run

- Generate `index.html` from the captured source snapshot: `npm run build`
- Start local server (opens browser): `npm run dev`

By default, the page loads remote images/embeds. To force placeholders instead, use:

- `http://127.0.0.1:5173/?assets=placeholder`

To recapture the live-site source screenshots/tokens:

- `node scripts/hatamex-forensics.mjs`

## Design Tokens

- Primary tokens live in `styles/tokens.css`
- Live site `:root` variables + utility CSS live in `assets/css/hatamex.css`
- Live site styled-jsx keyframes needed by the hero collage live in `styles/app.css`

## Validation (Screenshots)

- Source captures: `validation/source/` (generated by `node scripts/hatamex-forensics.mjs`)
- Build captures: `validation/build/` (generated by `npm run validate`)

Notes:
- Validation screenshots are taken after the preloader completes and a short settle delay.
- Build validation uses remote media to match the live layout (default; can also force via `?assets=remote`).
- Source capture auto-accepts the cookie banner by setting `localStorage.cookie-consent-preferences` before navigation, so screenshots match the uncluttered layout.
